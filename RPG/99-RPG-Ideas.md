### Traits



- **Poison**
  
This attack poisons the target. Poisoned units lose 8 HP every turn until they are cured or are reduced to 1 HP. Poison can not, of itself, kill a unit.

- **Drain**
  
This unit drains health from living units, healing itself for half the amount of damage it deals (rounded down).

- **Plague**

When a unit is killed by a Plague attack, that unit is replaced with a Walking Corpse on the same side as the unit with the Plague attack. This doesn’t work on Undead or units in villages.

- **petrification**

This attack petrifies the target, turning it to stone. Units that have been petrified may not move or attack.
