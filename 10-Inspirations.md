# YAPC - Inspirations

From the release of the Raspbery Pi Pico in January 2021 till now (december 2023), there are many projects around VGA and DVI/HDMI screen output, surrounded by a more ancient wave of other retro computers using other micro-controllers and/or 8 or 16 bits CPUs, mainly because old 8 bits computers are either too old or too expensive compared to what Arduino, ESP32 & al. cost and are able to achieve.

Here's now a list of projects that are related to this:

## Pico stuff

### **VGA scanvideo** from `pico-extras` by the **Raspberry Pi Foundation**

- For me, this is the base for all of this!
- <https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras/tree/master/src/common/pico_scanvideo>

### **VGA demo board** by **Pimoroni**

- Implementation of reference design from chapter 3 of <https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf>
- <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-vga-demo-base>
- RGAB5515 output: 5 bits for red, green and blue, 1 bit for alpha / transparency

### **First thread about VGA** on the **Raspberry Pi forums**

- That's what interested me in this stuff, I bought a couple Picos in early 2021 and then the VGA demo board
- <https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=1829133>

### **HAGL** by **tuupola**

- Generic library for bitmap graphics, originally written with IÂ²C or SPI LCD panels in mind
- <https://github.com/tuupola/hagl/>

- Can be extended to new types of screens via an **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**, cf. below

### **HAGL HAL for Pico VGA board** by **CHiPs44** (itâ€™s me ;-))

- <https://github.com/CHiPs44/hagl_pico_vgaboard>
- Framebuffer based
- For the VGA demo board
- Implements many VGA modes from <http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing> and several other sources
- Still buggy in terms of stability when using some modes and/or framebuffer manipulation techniques
- Has a rather complete demo

### **pshell** by **lurk101**

- Serial accessible shell
- With vi (from busybox)
- And C compiler generating ARM M0+ code
- <https://github.com/lurk101/pshell>
- Uses internal flash by default with LittleFS, SD card support for VGA board

### **pt52** by **DarkElevenAngel**

- VT-52 compatible serial terminal with vi editor that uses the VGA demo board
- <https://gitlab.com/DarkElvenAngel/pt52>
- **pt52-lua** is on the way, cf. <https://gitlab.com/DarkElvenAngel/pt52-lua>

### **PicoVGA** by **Miroslav Nemecek**

- <https://github.com/Panda381/PicoVGA>

### **Picocomputer 6502** by **Rumbledethumps**

- <https://github.com/picocomputer>
- 8Â Mhz 65C02 as CPU + 2 supporting Picos for VGA and I/O
- Interesting concept of the PIX to handle communication between the Picos via PIO

- Handles GPIO, IÂ²C, SPI from MMBasic
- WebMite has interesting ideas about networking functions (NTP, ...)

### **Neotron Pico** by **Jonathan Pallant (the JPster)**

- <https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico>
- VGA is a 12 bits (RGB444) implementation of scanvideo to limit the amount of GPIO pins used
- Code is written in Rust (and intended as a showcase of embedded Rust)
- I/O controller is not a Pico, but there is an interesting notion of BIOS and an API to communicate via SPI (or serial ?)
- Motherboard is in micro ATX form factor and embeds several expansion connectors usable with SPI (or IÂ²C?)

### **Picoputer** by **amen**

- Emulation of Transputer nodes
- <https://github.com/blackjetrock/picoputer>
- <https://trochilidae.blogspot.com/2021/07/stack-based-with-os-in-hardware.html>
