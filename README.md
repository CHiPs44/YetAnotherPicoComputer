As I heard recently in an Youtube video recorded at one of VCFxx conferences:

"**Retro is a feeling, Vintage is a date**"

This is a set of documents I maintain about the possible making of a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) based self-contained computer reminiscing 80's and 90's home computers.

There are also some ideas about a heroic fantasy RPG that could be implemented on this.
