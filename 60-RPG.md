"One RPG To Rule Them All And In Darkness Bind Them" ;-)

## Goals

Goal is to describe a minimalist rPG system that would be as simple as possible to implement on an 8bit/16bit-ish system.

Another goal is to not reinvent the wheel and use classical rules from D&D / d20 System for characters and monsters.
